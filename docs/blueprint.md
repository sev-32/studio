# **App Name**: Segmentify

## Core Features:

- Magic Wand Tool: Allows users to select image regions based on color and texture similarity using a region-growing algorithm.
- Magic Lasso Tool: Enables users to define image segments with precise, free-form selections using a live-wire pathfinding algorithm.
- Color Space Selection: Offers a variety of color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB, Quaternion) to optimize segmentation based on image characteristics. This enables testing the different color spaces.
- Real-time Parameter Adjustment: Provides immediate visual feedback as users adjust algorithm parameters, ensuring intuitive fine-tuning.
- Segmentation Algorithm Presets: Loads parameters suitable for performing common image edits, such as removing a background from an image, so that the model can do its work efficiently as a tool.
- Visual Analytics Panel: Offers a suite of visualization tools (e.g., histograms, pixel grids) for in-depth analysis of segmentation results. The goal is to visualize intermediate states and final outputs of algorithms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) – A vibrant blue (#3399FF) reminiscent of precision and clarity in image editing.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) – An off-white (#F0F8FF) that provides a clean and non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 80%, 40%) – A teal (#33CCCC) that complements the primary blue and highlights interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent tools and functionalities. Ensure icons are easily recognizable and consistent.
- Implement a clean and modular layout with a central canvas area and adjustable side panels for tools and settings.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on user interactions. These should enhance the user experience without being distracting.
